# **Road Crossing Assistant**

![main-img](images/roadcross-img.jpg)

## üí° Introduction

Roads in medium-sized Indian towns often have lots of traffic but no (or disregarded) traffic stops. This makes it hard to cross the roads safely, because it involves predicting safe durations using one‚Äôs sight. In this project, we are training image based ML models to predict road crossing safety. 

This repository includes Python implementation for various approaches we developed for the prediction model.

## üóÉ Dataset

Any suitable dataset did not exist (datasets for autonomous cars are not recorded from a pedestrian‚Äôs point of view), so we have created our own dataset. Our dataset contains 104 videos from diverse locations, time, traffic patterns, collected using an action camera from different roads of Anand, Gujarat.

## üî® Implementation

### 1. Machine Learning - Single Frame SVM


#### [**Approach 1.1 (precision : 0.50, recall : 0.70)** ![Approach 1.1](https://img.icons8.com/fluent-systems-filled/18/0366D6/external-link.png)](https://github.com/roadcross-assistant/Project/blob/master/ML/Approach_1.1_individual_frames.ipynb)

It is our simplest approach where we extracted simple per-frame features capturing number, location and size of vehicles. We used SVM to train the classification model. 

#### [**Approach 1.2 (precision : 0.54 , recall : 0.74)** ![Approach 1.2](https://img.icons8.com/fluent-systems-filled/18/0366D6/external-link.png)](https://github.com/roadcross-assistant/Project/blob/master/ML/Approach_1.2_individual_frames.ipynb)

It is an advancement over Approach 1.1 where we have improved our feature extraction logic by ignoring the vehicles traveling on the opposite half of the road (using vehicle tracking)

#### [**Approach 1.3 (precision : 0.68 , recall : 0.87)** ![Approach 1.3](https://img.icons8.com/fluent-systems-filled/18/0366D6/external-link.png)](https://github.com/roadcross-assistant/Project/blob/master/ML/Approach_1.3_individual_frames.ipynb)

It is an advancement over Approach 1.2 where we have improved our feature extraction logic by considereing relative speed of the vehicles, and we also improved labels by annotating the videos frame-wise (instead of second-wise).

&nbsp;

### 2. Machine Learning - Multi Frame SVM

#### [**Approach 2.1 (precision : 0.74 , recall : 0.88)** ![Approach 2.1](https://img.icons8.com/fluent-systems-filled/18/0366D6/external-link.png)](https://github.com/roadcross-assistant/Project/blob/master/ML/Approach_2.1_multiple_frames.ipynb)

As it is obvious that even we as humans do not decide whether it is safe to cross a road by just having one glance at the road, we have started using multi-frame features instead of individual-frame features in this approach.

#### [**Approach 2.2 (precision : 0.79 , recall : 0.83)** ![Approach 2.2](https://img.icons8.com/fluent-systems-filled/18/0366D6/external-link.png)](https://github.com/roadcross-assistant/Project/blob/master/ML/Approach_2.2_multiple_frames.ipynb)

It is similar to Approach 2.1, in which we have used multi-frame features in a sliding window based manner. Its feature extraction logic is a bit optimized as compared to that of Approach 2.1.

&nbsp;

### 3. Deep Learning - Single frame CNN


#### [**Approach 3.1 (precision : 0.90 , recall : 0.60)** ![Approach 3.1](https://img.icons8.com/fluent-systems-filled/18/0366D6/external-link.png)](https://github.com/roadcross-assistant/Project/blob/master/DL/Approach_3.1.py)

In Approach 3.1, we used the MobileNetV2 architecture with additional dense layers at the top. We used the MobileNetV2 because it is a lightweight architecture particularly useful for mobile and embedded vision applications.

#### [**Approach 3.2 (precision : 0.90 , recall : 0.73)** ![Approach 3.2](https://img.icons8.com/fluent-systems-filled/18/0366D6/external-link.png)](https://github.com/roadcross-assistant/Project/blob/master/DL/Approach_3.2.py)

As Approach 3.1 did not give a satisfactory performance on test data, in Approach 3.2 we have developed our own CNN architecture from scratch. However, since it's convolutional layers consisted of kernels of size greater than 3, its inference speed was very low even after optimization to a TensorRT graph.

#### [**Approach 3.3 (precision : 0.90 , recall : 0.77)** ![Approach 3.3](https://img.icons8.com/fluent-systems-filled/18/0366D6/external-link.png)](https://github.com/roadcross-assistant/Project/blob/master/DL/Approach_3.3.py)

It is an advancement over approach 3.2, in which we have replaced the convolutional layers with larger kernal size with dilated convolutional layers. This resulted in a higher inference speed after optimization to TensorRT graph.
